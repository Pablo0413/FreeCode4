          Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages. The following pages are a useful first step to get on your way writing programs with Python!
        </p>
       
        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

          The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party modules for Python. Both Python's standard library and the community-contributed modules allow for endless possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just run the program directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don't have to worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Python programs much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another computer and it just works!

          Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.
        </p>

        <p>Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libr√© and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.

        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>

        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>

        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>x = 42.</code>
        <code
          >This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</code
        >

        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>let y = 13.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
